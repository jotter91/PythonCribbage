<h1>PyCribbage</h1>

<p>PyCribbage is a Python application for simulating a card game called Cribbage. </p>

<p>An overview of the rules of the game and the terminology used can be found [here] (https://www.theukrules.co.uk/rules/children/games/cards/cribbage.html)</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Download this repo to use this library. You can use Poetry to install the necessary dependencies. After downloading the repo and changing into the directory:</p>

<p><code>bash
poetry install
</code></p>

<p>Alternatively, you may may mainly install the dependencies in pyproject.toml using your preferred package manager</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To play an interactive game launch main.py and follow the on screen prompts</p>

<p><code>bash
python pycribbage/main.py
</code></p>

<p>The prompts will ask for information on which methods to use. The methods are split into the two parts of a cribbage game, The Show and The Play. </p>

<p>Currently your opponent can use either a random choice during the game or a repeatable choice (useful for replaying the same game). </p>
